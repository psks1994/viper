#VIPER-Virtual Intelligent Pesonal Emergency Record.


##Abstract
In this project we are implementing a Virtual Intelligent Personal Emergency Resource (V.I.P.E.R) scheme with different levels of security. This scheme will allow users to create account to save information and provide access to their accounts from anywhere, anytime. The security scheme has been categorized into two scenarios: Nonemergency and Emergency. In nonemergency scenario registered users are allowed to access the Patient Health Record (PHR) according to the role they are playing. But in emergency, when a request comes, the situation will be analyzed before allowing or aborting the access to unauthorized user by providing the adaptive access control based on the contextual and trust attribute. The project will be put under new generation ubiquitous security technique.
